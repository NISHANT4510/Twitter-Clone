🧭 What You Should Build Next:
🔹 1. User Profile Page (Start today)
This is the natural next step, as every feature ahead (tweeting, following, feeds) needs a user identity.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Breakdown:
📁 Backend (Node/Express + MongoDB):
User Schema – Add fields if not already:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  name,
  email,
  username, // unique
  bio,
  profilePicture, // optional
  followers: [],  // array of user IDs
  following: []   // array of user IDs
}
Routes:

GET /api/users/:username – Fetch user profile

PUT /api/users/:id – Update profile (name, bio, etc.)

🎨 Frontend (React):
Route: /profile/:username

Page Layout:

Show: Name, Username, Email, Bio, Profile Picture

Add: “Edit Profile” (if current user)

Edit Profile Form:

Modal or separate page

Update name, bio, profile picture

🔐 Bonus:
Use the JWT token to identify the logged-in user and only allow them to edit their own profile.

📌 Optional Enhancements:
Allow uploading profile picture (Multer + Cloudinary)

Add username uniqueness check

Auto-generate usernames during signup (e.g., @nishant123)
